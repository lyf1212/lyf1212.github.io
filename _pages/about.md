Hi!😁 I'm Yifan Li (李一凡). I am currently a junior undergraduate at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), major in Data Science and Big Data Technology. I've joined in the Spatial and Temporal Restoration, Understanding and Compression Team [(STRUCT)](http://39.96.165.147/struct.html) as an undergraduate intern. My current research interests are computer vision and computational photography, especially image/video restoration and enhancement.
