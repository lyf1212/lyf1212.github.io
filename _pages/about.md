Hi!üòÅ I'm Yifan Li (Êùé‰∏ÄÂá°). I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), major in Data Science and Big Data Technology. I've joined in the Spatial and Temporal Restoration, Understanding and Compression Team [(STRUCT)](http://39.96.165.147/struct.html) as an undergraduate intern, supervised by [Prof. Jiaying Liu](http://39.96.165.147/people/liujiaying.html) and [Prof. Shuai Yang](https://williamyang1991.github.io/). My current research interests are computer vision and computational photography, especially image/video restoration and enhancement. Now I am working on image/video colorization, trying my best to restore a colorful and vivid world!
